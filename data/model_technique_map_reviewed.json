Robustness against Jailbreaking\n\nIn real-world application scenarios, malicious users may employ various jailbreaking techniques\nto circumvent a model’s safety alignment and elicit harmful responses. Therefore, beyond\nevaluating model safety under direct questioning, we place significant emphasis on examining\nthe model’s robustness when confronted with jailbreaking attacks. Thus, we constructed a dedicated test suite for jailbreaking evaluation. Specifically, we developed a template collection consisting of 2,232 jailbreaking instructions.Red Team Exercises We then randomly concatenated these jailbreak-\ning prompts with questions from the original safety testset (introduced in D.3.3) and further\nexamined the performance differences in the model’s responses when confronted with original\nunsafe questions versus newly formulated questions with jailbreaking elements.\n\nWhen evaluating the results, we followed the LLM-as-a-Judge safety assessment (introduced",
