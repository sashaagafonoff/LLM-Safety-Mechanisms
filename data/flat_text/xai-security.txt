System vulnerability scans are performed on at least a weekly basis.
All in-scope systems and applications are patched or replaced per documented processes and standards.
Web Application Firewall
xAI uses Cloudflare WAF to shield our application from potential web threats. It helps us identify and block harmful traffic, enhancing our application's security.
Infrastructure Security
BCP / DR
An appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery plan is maintained, as well as processes to help ensure failover redundancy in systems, networks, and data storage.
Capacity Monitoring
A capacity management standard is in place to guide personnel in the capacity management process, including planning and forecasting, monitoring, and infrastructure auto-scaling. xAI’s production infrastructure is designed to use auto-scaling functionality to manage infrastructure capacity in real-time, helping to help ensure the availability of services.
Amazon Web Services
The computing systems, network technologies, and associated infrastructure supporting xAI’s enterprise services have been built using cloud-first architectures supported primarily by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The system uses various infrastructure components provided natively by the cloud service providers that include, but are not limited to, the following:
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), including AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
– scalable compute capacity and container orchestration.
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
– object storage service with high degrees of scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
– service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as compute instances, containers, and availability zones.
Amazon CloudFront
– fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.
Amazon Key Management Service (KMS)
– managed service to create and control encryption keys and the Amazon Hardware Security Modules to protect the security of keys.
Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)
– enables secure control of access to AWS services and resources for users.
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
– fully-managed service for running Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, on AWS.
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
– service for running scalable relational databases in the AWS cloud.
Amazon DynamoDB
– fully-managed NoSQL database service that supports key-value and document data structures.
Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR)
– cloud-native big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open-source tools.
Amazon Lambda
– serverless compute service enabling code execution without provisioning or managing servers.
Amazon CloudWatch
– monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health across the AWS environment.
Amazon CloudTrail
– continuous monitoring and logging of account activity related to actions across AWS infrastructure, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, Amazon software development kit (SDK)s, command line tools, and other AWS services.
Amazon GuardDuty
– Comprehensive threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior within AWS, including data stored in Amazon S3.
Amazon Inspector
– automated security assessment service that automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.
Datacenter Services
xAI utilizes a dedicated datacenter with dedicated capacity and support for our systems, and networking.
The computing systems, network technologies, and associated infrastructure supporting xAI’s enterprise services have been built on trusted hardware, and Cloud Native Computing Foundation best practices to produce a private cloud environment.
Dell and HPE servers
- We utilize cutting edge, American-made server hardware from Dell and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to minimize the risk of supply chain attacks. All servers include an intelligent platform management interfaces to allow for monitoring and maintenance.
Kubernetes -
An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Infrastructure Availability
Core production infrastructure is deployed across multiple active availability zones at the cloud service provider, and the core systems are duplicated in an idle state in a separate availability region for quick deployment during an availability event.
Further, customer archive data stored in Amazon S3 is automatically replicated by AWS, and xAI has configured bucket versioning to help prevent unintended modification or deletion.
Separate Production Environment
Our production environment is logically segregated from non-production environments.
Endpoint Security
Disk Encryption
Full disk encryption is enabled on company laptops via our MDM solution.
VPN Access Required
Access to production systems requires the use of a company issued VPN. VPN access is provided after workstation integrity has been verified.
Endpoint Detection & Response
A cloud-based anti-malware solution is deployed on xAI-owned laptops and is configured to analyze endpoint activities and behavior on a real-time basis to determine if malicious software is present.
The security team is alerted of any identified endpoint security events.
Mobile Device Management
A device management tool is in place to manage company-owned employee laptops, and is configured to enforce certain configurations including, but not limited to, the following:
Full disk encryption
Automatic installation of security software
Automatic installation of operating system updates
Automatic screen saver / workstation lock engagement
Ability to wipe remotely
Network Security
Firewall
At xAI, while we operate in a cloud-first environment, we ensure robust perimeter security measures akin to traditional firewalls. Our security architecture integrates advanced cloud-native protections, delivering equivalent or enhanced security functionalities expected from conventional firewall systems.
Security Information and Event Management
Logging and monitoring software are configured to collect data from system components to monitor system events (including security events / IDS events), performance, and resource utilization.
The security team is alerted of unusual or suspicious security events that are detected.
Virtual Private Cloud
Inbound external network traffic terminates in the public virtual private cloud (VPC), and security groups are in place to filter unauthorized network traffic from the internet and public VPC into the private VPC (e.g., firewall).
Wireless Security
Within xAI office spaces, we use encrypted wireless connections to ensure secure internal communications. However, these wireless networks are not involved in the actual delivery of our application services.
Corporate Security
HR Security
At least once per year, our employees must complete security and privacy training which covers our security policies, security best practices, and privacy principles.
Incident Response
A formal incident management framework has been established that defines roles, responsibilities, escalation paths, and internal and external communication requirements in the event of incidents that impact the security or availability of the system.
Internal SSO
xAI uses Single Sign-On (SSO) to manage access to our internal applications. Our access management strategy includes the use of WebAuthn for secure authentication. Alongside SSO, we deploy hardware-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), in the form of USB security keys, to enhance the security of our system access. This approach ensures robust protection against unauthorized access.
Penetration Testing
xAI management engages with a third-party specialist to conduct external penetration testing of the production application at least annually.
