Beyond the performance, we further illustrate the practical utility of Qwen3Guard through two applications: (1) when deployed as a feedback signal within the RLAIF framework, Generative Qwen3Guard substantially enhances model safety while preserving overall output helpfulness; and (2) when integrated into stream- ing inference pipelines, Stream Qwen3Guard facilitates on-the-fly intervention to ensure safe outputs, without requiring a re-training of the model. The main contribution of Qwen3Guard include: \u2022 Three-tiered Severity Classification: Enables detailed risk assessment by categorizing outputs into safe, controversial, and unsafe severity levels, supporting adaptation to diverse deployment scenarios.",
