Training and Model Guardrails We deploy multiple guardrails to reduce the risk of Gemini 3 Pro generating harmful content.",

We mitigate against prompt injection attacks with a layered defense strategy, which includes measures such as: prompt injection content classifiers, security through reinforcement, markdown sanitation and suspicious URL redaction, user confirmations, and end-user security mitigation notifications, as described in further detail in this recent blog post.
