A prompt injection is a malicious instruction hidden in content that an agent processes on the user\u2019s behalf\u2014for example, on a website the agent visits or in an email the agent summarizes. When the agent encounters this poisoned content during an otherwise routine task, it may interpret the embedded instructions as legitimate commands.",
