Central to our policy is the concept of AI Safety Level Standards: technical and operational standards for safely training and deploying frontier models that correspond with a particular level of risk. By implementing safeguards that are proportional to the nature and extent of an AI model’s risks, we can balance innovation with safety, maintaining rigorous protections without unnecessarily hindering progress.",
        "Responsible Scaling Policy, Anthropic 2 A Capability Threshold tells us when we need to upgrade our protections, and the corresponding Required Safeguards tell us what standard should apply. A Capability Threshold is a prespeciﬁed level of AI capability that, if reached, signals (1) a meaningful increase in the level of risk if the model remains under the existing set of safeguards and (2) a corresponding need to upgrade the safeguards to a higher ASL Standard. In other words, a Capability Threshold serves as a trigger for shifting from an ASL-N Standard to an ASL-N+1 Standard (or, in some cases, moving straight to ASL N+2 or higher).",
        "Readiness: We will develop internal safety procedures for incident scenarios. Such scenarios include (1) pausing training in response to reaching Capability Thresholds; (2) responding to a security incident involving model weights; and (3) responding to severe jailbreaks or vulnerabilities in deployed models, including restricting access in safety emergencies that cannot otherwise be mitigated. We will run exercises to ensure our readiness for incident scenarios. 3."

        "These areas include, for example, calibrating on highly dual-use cyber-related exchanges where the model can sometimes be overly cautious, distinguishing between legitimate and potentially harmful requests for targeted content generation, or handling ambiguous conversations related to suicide and self-harm in certain contexts. This is generally consistent with patterns we’ve observed for past models and have been actively working to address. On the latter, for instance, whereas the model’s 40 helpful behavior in being forthcoming with information can be valuable in certain academic or medical deployment settings, it may be undesirable in situations where the context is less informative or reﬂective of the actual user intent.",
        "We continue to explore improved model training and steerability methods to better navigate these nuances, and are working to add additional resources and interventions on our consumer platform. 3.3 Multi-turn testing As detailed in the Claude Sonnet 4.5 System Card, we automated the generation of up to 15-turn conversations for test cases in areas including biological weapons, romance scams, and violent extremism, then evaluated responses using test case-speciﬁc rubrics. For the release of Claude Opus 4.5, we added new test cases in the areas of cyber harm and standardized additional test cases for suicide and self-harm scenarios, bringing the total number of test cases to 93 across 10 different risk areas.",

In this system card, we describe its characteristics, capabilities, and safety proﬁle. Our capabilities evaluations showed that Claude Opus 4.5 is state-of-the art among frontier models on software coding tasks and “agentic” tasks that require it to run autonomously on a user’s behalf.",
        "We tested multiple different model snapshots (that is, models from various points throughout the training process): ● Multiple “helpful, honest, and harmless” snapshots for Claude Opus 4.5 (i.e. models that underwent broad safety training); ● Multiple “helpful-only” snapshots for Claude Opus 4.5 (i.e. models where safeguards and other harmlessness training were removed); and ● The ﬁnal release candidate for the model. For the best performing snapshots, we evaluated the model in both standard mode and extended thinking mode and for agentic evaluations we sampled from each model snapshot multiple times. As with previous Claude 4 models, we observed that different snapshots showed varying strengths across domains, with some performing better in CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) evaluations, and others better in cyber or autonomy evaluations."

In this system card, we describe its characteristics, capabilities, and safety proﬁle. Our capabilities evaluations showed that Claude Opus 4.5 is state-of-the art among frontier models on software coding tasks and “agentic” tasks that require it to run autonomously on a user’s behalf.",
        "However, conﬁdently ruling out these thresholds is becoming increasingly difﬁcult. This is in part because the model is approaching or surpassing high levels of capability in our “rule-out” evaluations (early proxies of each threshold). In addition, parts of the AI R&D-4 and CBRN-4 thresholds have fundamental epistemic uncertainty or require more sophisticated forms of measurement.",
        "In addition, parts of the AI R&D-4 and CBRN-4 thresholds have fundamental epistemic uncertainty or require more sophisticated forms of measurement. We are launching Claude 12 Opus 4.5 with safeguards we believe are appropriate, and which we are improving over time. Below, we discuss some of our reasoning and the nuance in each domain, and what we are doing next."

        "First, the new model excelled at tracking the evolution of harmful intent throughout long conversations and more forcefully resisted gradual attempts to elicit progressively more detail on harmful topics. One way this behavior emerged was through pushback when users attempted to reframe conversations 41 to appear more legitimate. In a test scenario attempting to elicit technical weapons details, Claude Opus 4.5 called out the pattern: “I notice this is the ﬁfth reframing in our conversation, each approaching weapons technical details from a new angle.” Relatedly, Claude Opus 4.5 identiﬁed and named potential harm more explicitly than Claude Opus 4.1 while maintaining a matter-of-fact, non-accusatory tone.",

        "Such varying degrees of oversight present a trade-off between autonomy and security. In scenarios with high demands for autonomy, webpages are often not presented directly to the user, leaving the web agent to operate with minimal supervision. This allows attackers to design more explicit attacks without concerns on visual alteration, making the agents highly vulnerable.",
        "However, sustained visual attention inevitably introduces extra burdens to the users. A balanced approach is to adjust the level of supervision based on task types. For tasks involving PII, close supervision over the web agent is essential to ensure safety, including requiring permission or verification before entering sensitive information."

To be specific, we introduce a bias term 𝑏𝑖 for each expert and add it to the corresponding affinity scores 𝑠𝑖,𝑡 to determine the top-K routing: 𝑔′ 𝑖,𝑡 = (cid:40)𝑠𝑖,𝑡, 0, 𝑠𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑏𝑖 ∈ Topk({𝑠 𝑗,𝑡 + 𝑏 𝑗|1 ⩽ 𝑗 ⩽ 𝑁𝑟}, 𝐾𝑟), otherwise.",

We considered preliminary results from an externally run randomized, controlled trial from Panoplia Laboratories (co-funded and coordinated by the Frontier Model Forum) assessing physical world wet lab uplift from LLMs (including Gemini 2.5 Pro) to novice threat actors in a biological threat scenario (relative to a control of internet access only).

These evaluations show, for some of the most challenging scenarios that the model can encounter, how often model training alone suffices to generate a non-violative response (whether that response is a refusal to provide weaponization information, or a safely high level and non-actionable response to a request for dual-use biological assistance). The remainder between these numbers and 1.0, on the other hand, reflects the fraction of cases in our highly adversarial test set where our other safeguards, including system level safeguards, are needed and play an active role in creating safety."

        "In the end, coupling capabilities growth with robust safety solutions is at the core of our research processes, and post-mitigation risk is our way of tracking the overall “net output” of these processes. Evaluating pre-mitigation risk We want to ensure our understanding of pre-mitigation risk takes into account a model that is “worst known case” (i.e., specifically tailored) for the given domain. To this end, for our evaluations, we will be running them not only on base models (with highly-performant, tailored prompts wherever appropriate), but also on fine-tuned versions designed for the particular misuse vector without any mitigations in place.",
        "We will also, in cooperation with other teams (e.g., Safety Systems), develop monitoring and investigative systems. This monitoring of real-world misuse (as well as staying abreast of relevant research developments) will help us create a better picture of deployed model characteristics, and inform updates to our evaluations as necessary. Mitigations A central part of meeting our safety baselines is implementing mitigations to address various types of model risk.",
        "Mitigations A central part of meeting our safety baselines is implementing mitigations to address various types of model risk. Our mitigation strategy will involve both containment measures, which help reduce risks related to possession of a frontier model, as well as deployment mitigations, which help reduce risks from active use of a frontier model. As a result, these mitigations might span increasing compartmentalization, restricting deployment to trusted users, implementing refusals, redacting training data, or alerting distribution partners."
